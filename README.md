# Little Lemon Project Capstone

## Meta proffesional Certificate

This repository serves the Little Lemon project for the Meta Proffesional Certificate.

## Goals

The Little Lemon restaurant needs a reserve a table feature along with a homepage and other relevant sections. It should follow Dieter Ram's Principles of Good Design, Nielsen's Heuristics and Shneidermann's golden rules of interface design to ensure the designs are useful and accessible. The reservation feature should have a date, time selection, special requests and a confirmation screen after the booking has been completed.
